# Multi-Agent Self-Alignment Ecosystem: Peer-Reviewed Alignment Through Collaborative AI Agents Without Human Supervision
We propose MASAE ‚Äî a new paradigm for aligning large language models through a multi-agent ecosystem. This system uses an ensemble of intelligent agents (Truth, Logic, Ethics, and Consensus Agents) that autonomously peer-review, critique, and refine model outputs to enforce truthful, logical, and ethical behavior ‚Äî entirely without human reward modeling.

# Problem
Traditional alignment methods like RLHF and Constitutional AI rely on:
- Costly human feedback and annotations
- Limited generalization to diverse or adversarial inputs
- Centralized single-critic architectures prone to bias and brittleness
- These approaches often fail under logical conflict, ambiguity, or conflicting values.

# Solution
MASAE replaces monolithic alignment with a collaborative, decentralized ecosystem of AI agents. Key innovations include:
- Peer-Reviewed Self-Alignment: Agents evaluate each other's outputs based on domain-specific criteria.
- Multi-Agent Critique Loop: Enables iterative refinement using logic, factual accuracy, and ethics.
- Adversarial Disagreement Handling: A consensus agent resolves disagreement by probabilistic arbitration.
- No Human Feedback Required: All supervision is synthetic, generated by agent interactions.

# Results
Truthfulness: +31% over RLHF and Constitutional AI
- Ethical Reasoning: +28% improvement
- Logical Consistency: +35% gain
- Adversarial Robustness: +42% increase in performance under distributional shifts
- Cost Efficiency: Significant reduction in supervision and labeling costs
- Tested across models ranging from 500M to 5B parameters using the HHH Benchmark, TruthfulQA, and logic-heavy scenarios.

# Core Contributions
- First system to formalize alignment as multi-agent decentralized reasoning
- Demonstrates emergent self-alignment without human preference labels
- Introduces adaptive critique-refinement protocols for recursive learning

# Keywords
